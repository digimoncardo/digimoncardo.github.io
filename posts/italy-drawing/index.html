While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=beautiful-village-in-italy--drawing>Beautiful Village In Italy : Drawing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#beautiful-village-in-italy--drawing>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://external-preview.redd.it/MCt27UDc7qN_ov_9wex97-dtbRJR1ALZqq8Ez8vri0M.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=8593ab7eb69e1f13825d33223cf993c8b3a9e750" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.FFbE9SPavwihsesSKwcdewHaFw&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Beautiful village in Italy : drawing"><p><em>Source: reddit.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Conclusion
