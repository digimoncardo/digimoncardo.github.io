While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=top-10-dumbest-cartoon-characters-part-1--cartoon-amino-1>Top 10 Dumbest Cartoon Characters Part 1 | Cartoon Amino<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#top-10-dumbest-cartoon-characters-part-1--cartoon-amino-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://pm1.narvii.com/6281/172f76333f7670e18cc4104b4a1a1d1a325b50de_hq.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.o3vvEzxmztF-PHu_qvMymQHaDr&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Top 10 Dumbest Cartoon Characters Part 1 | Cartoon Amino"><p><em>Source: aminoapps.com</em></p><blockquote><p>dumbest.</p></blockquote><p>Anime wallpaper is a popular way to add some extra excitement to your home screen.
