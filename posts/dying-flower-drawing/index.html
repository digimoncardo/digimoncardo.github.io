-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=dying-flower-drawing---driverlayer-search-engine-3>Dying Flower Drawing - DriverLayer Search Engine<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dying-flower-drawing---driverlayer-search-engine-3>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://img07.deviantart.net/ec7d/i/2008/313/5/9/dying_flowers_by_kariganthestrange.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.e3JsnWGpVBjZcf-skUcdvwHaJu&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="dying flower drawing - DriverLayer Search Engine"><p><em>Source: driverlayer.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Cool wallpapers for different devices:
