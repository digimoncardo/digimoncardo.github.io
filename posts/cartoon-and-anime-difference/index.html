While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=difference-between-anime-and-cartoon--4-reasons-why-anime-is-not-a>Difference Between Anime And Cartoon | 4 Reasons Why Anime Is Not A<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#difference-between-anime-and-cartoon--4-reasons-why-anime-is-not-a>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.countshout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Difference-between-anime-and-cartoon.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.wwsigQeMBXD7jx_VqsOw9AHaEU&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Difference Between Anime And Cartoon | 4 Reasons Why Anime Is Not A"><p><em>Source: countshout.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Types of Anime: Animation, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Sports, and more
